# plotting-with-python

This is a jupyter notebook that is used in the "Let's plot with Python - Part 1" tutorial for my labmate at TAMU Deparment of Oceanography. You can watch the recorded video from this link: https://youtu.be/cgrs_w1PZPw

I am not a programmer/data scientist (yet), so take my tutorial as a grain of salt. I am trying to explain everything from a perspective of a newbie for python programming.
